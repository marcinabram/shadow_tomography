**shadow-tomography-circuit-agreement.ipynb**

A proposition how to measure whether two circuits are the same.

**shadow-tomography-circuit-agreement-5qubits.ipynb**

A test on a larger, 5-qubit circuit.

**shadow-tomography-circuit-agreement-variation.ipynb**

Several runs of the methods to test how variable the results are.
